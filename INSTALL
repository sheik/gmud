In order to make this client, you will need the latest QT development libraries installed. You will also need gcc with the C++ extensions.

Once you have all this, enter the GMUD directory and do:

user@host$ qmake
user@host$ make

This should be sufficient on GNU/Linux and OS X. For windows, you may have to make sure that WS2_32.lib is included in gmud.pro, doing something like this:

LIBS += -L c:\libs -l WS2_32

You will also have to have ws2_32.dll and another qt dll in your execution path (or in the same directory as GMUD)
